        <text>Bring your water to a stable, rolling boil and slowly add your 60 min hop addition (watch for boilover) and start your timer for 60 min. While boiling, sanitize any equipment that will come into contact with your wort after the boil:
            a. Measure 5 gallons of water and pour 1 oz (two capfuls) of Io-Star sanitizer into your fermentor (mark the 5 gal level on the outside of your carboy) and allow to sit for 1 min.
            b. Use auto-siphon to rack the sanitizer into a spare bucket or tub and use to sanitize rest of
            equipment:
            i. Funnel, airlock, stopper, and wine thief</text>

        <text>With 15 min left until the end of your boil, pause your timer and turn the flame off to halt the boil, then add your malt extract. Be sure to pour slowly and stir constantly to ensure all extract (DME) dissolves completely. Once fully dissolved, turn the heat back on. Watch for boil-overs again, as they become more likely the more extract you add. Have countermeasures for boil-over ready:
            i. Be prepared to turn the heat down or off.
            ii. Have a spray bottle of water ready to help keep foam at bay.</text>
